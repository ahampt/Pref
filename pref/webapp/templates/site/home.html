		<h3>News - updated 5/30</h3>
		<p>Development is proceeding nicely on version 1.2 which will be the last update until 2.0. 2.0 will bring support for new consumeable types such as comics, tv shows, games, beers, or anything else I have an interest in recording. Suggestions are always welcome and will spur development in certain directions if so desired. Version 1.1.8 was just launched and is the last update before 1.2 bringing with it a slew of fixes and updates. UI functions have been fixed and improved in most cases and new features dealing with social networks and other applications such as <a href="http://www.letterboxd.com/">letterboxd</a>. Version 1.2 will be the biggest update since launch in a couple of weeks bringing list support allowing for personalized lists to be created and manipulated completing the initial vision I had for the site. Filters will also be added so lists can be easily created and data can be easier to view in a more comprehensive format. With filters will come some cool data visualation tools similar to that of letterboxd because they're cool. That's all for now, feel free to contact me anytime and thanks for using Pref.</p>
